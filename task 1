Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP-hypertext transfer protocol, this is the application protocol that exchanges the 
information between a user computer and a local or world wide web. 

HTTP1.1 
* it process, only one request which can be outstanding on a connection at a time.
* if multiple resources are needed to render a web page. then it has to requested sequentially which leads to latency issues and slower page download time.
* each HTTP request and responce includes headers containing metadata about message.thes headers are sent in plain text and leads to excessive data being sent over networks.
* it gives only the informatino or works according to the request thrown by the user. even though it has extra useful informations on that particular requst it will deny it. 
* it is a text based protocol, with headers and data encoded as plain text.

HTTP2
* It introduces multiplexing, which allows multiple request and responce can be sent and recived simultaneously on a single connection.
* this version reducesd the latency and improved efficiency by eleminating the need for multiple connections to fetch resources in parallel.
* they used header copmression technique to reduce overhead by compressing header fields, which resulted in lower data transfer and iprover preformanc.
* it supports server push, allows the server too forwardly push resources to  the user before they request.
* this is a inary protocol, means the headers and data encoded in a binary formate.
